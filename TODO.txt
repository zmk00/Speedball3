Changlelog v3.0:

	* Warmup2 implemented and improved.
	* Warmup/Pause vote from the Manage Server menu (the current round will end in a draw).
	
	* Default rounds limit changed to 7.
	* Default option for friendly fire is now enabled.
	* Default warmup duration changed to 10 seconds (the countdown starting when everyone is ready).
	* Default phase times changed to 4-2-2 (normal-reduction-instant, in minutes).
	
	* Ballbug quick fix (Update 3d markers every frame, need to optimize that).
	* Confirmed instant heal for ball carrier is a nadeo bug (there is a way to go around it but it needs lot of work).
	

TODO v3.0:

	x Redo matchmaking to be up-to-date (see below), if we get time over for it.
	x Show top cap procentage for each team in text.	

	
Matchmaking:

	Look at source of a different mode (like elite or battle) to see how they implement it and remake it from scratch.
	Should be compatible with:
